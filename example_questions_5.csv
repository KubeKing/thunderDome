"In object-oriented programming, what is the difference between method overloading and method overriding?","Method overloading allows multiple methods in the same class to have the same name but different parameters, enabling compile-time polymorphism. Method overriding allows a subclass to provide a specific implementation for a method already defined in its superclass, enabling runtime polymorphism.","Method overloading is when two methods have the same name but different parameters. Method overriding is when a subclass has a method with the same name and parameters as a method in its superclass but with a different implementation.",0.9
"Explain the difference between a stack and a queue data structure.","A stack is a Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) data structure where elements are added and removed from the same end, typically called the top. A queue is a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure where elements are added at one end (rear) and removed from the other end (front).","A stack uses LIFO (Last In First Out) where you can only remove the most recently added item. A queue uses FIFO (First In First Out) where items are removed in the order they were added.",0.8
"What is the time complexity of binary search and how does it work?","Binary search has a time complexity of O(log n). It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half. It begins with the entire sorted array, compares the middle element with the target value, and eliminates half of the remaining elements based on the comparison.","Binary search is O(log n) and works by checking the middle element of a sorted array, then discarding half the array based on if the target is greater or less than the middle value, until the element is found.",0.9
"What is a primary key in a relational database?","A primary key is a column or set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row in that table. It must contain unique values and cannot contain NULL values. Primary keys enforce entity integrity and are used to establish relationships between tables.","A primary key is a unique identifier for each record in a database table. No two rows can have the same primary key value, and it can't be null.",0.7
"What is the significance of the 'virtual' keyword in C++?","The 'virtual' keyword in C++ is used to declare a method that can be overridden in a derived class. When a method is declared as virtual, the compiler determines which method implementation to call at runtime based on the actual object type rather than the reference type, enabling runtime polymorphism.","Virtual in C++ means that a function can be overridden by derived classes, allowing for runtime polymorphism. Without virtual, the function to be called is determined at compile-time.",0.8
